 * BACKEND REMOVED FOR STATIC SITE CONVERSION
 * 
 * This file previously contained the Express.js server configuration
 * with authentication, contact management, and admin functionality.

 * For static site deployment, all backend functionality has been removed.
 * The site now operates as a client-side only application suitable for
 * hosting on platforms like:
 * - Netlify
 * - Vercel 
 * - GitHub Pages
 * - Render (Static Site)
 * 
 * Original functionality included:
 * - Express server with CORS and security middleware
 * - JWT authentication system
 * - SQLite database with user and contact management
 * - RESTful API endpoints for frontend integration
 * - Rate limiting and security headers
 * 
 * All HTML, CSS, JavaScript and static assets remain functional
