# ENVIRONMENT CONFIGURATION - REMOVED FOR STATIC SITE
#
# This file previously contained server-side environment variables for the
# Node.js backend application including database connections, JWT secrets,
# CORS settings, and other server configuration.
#
# Original environment variables included:
# - PORT=3000 (Server port)
# - NODE_ENV=development (Environment mode)
# - JWT_SECRET=secret-key (JWT signing secret)
# - FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5500 (CORS origin)
# - DB_PATH=./data/database.sqlite (Database file path)
# - RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=900000 (Rate limiting)
# - RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=100 (Rate limiting)
#
# All backend functionality has been removed for static site conversion.
# No environment variables are needed for static site deployment.
#
# For static hosting platforms, configuration is typically handled through:
# - Platform-specific settings (Netlify, Vercel, etc.)
# - Build configuration files
# - Static form handling services
# - Client-side environment configurations
