/*
 * AUTHENTICATION ROUTES - REMOVED FOR STATIC SITE
 * 
 * This file previously contained Express.js routes for user authentication
 * including registration, login, password management, and user administration.
 * 
 * Original functionality included:
 * - User registration with validation
 * - JWT-based login/logout system
 * - Password hashing with bcrypt
 * - Role-based access control (owner/member)
 * - User profile management
 * - Admin user management endpoints
 * 
 * All backend authentication has been removed for static site conversion.
 * Frontend forms may still exist but will not have functional backend processing.
 * 
 * For a production static site, consider implementing:
 * - Client-side form validation
 * - Integration with authentication services (Auth0, Firebase Auth, etc.)
 * - Static form handling services (Netlify Forms, Formspree, etc.)
