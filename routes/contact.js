/*
 * CONTACT ROUTES - REMOVED FOR STATIC SITE
 * 
 * This file previously contained Express.js routes for handling contact form
 * submissions and contact-related functionality.
 * 
 * Original functionality included:
 * - Contact form submission processing
 * - Email validation and sanitization
 * - Database storage of contact inquiries
 * - Contact form statistics and analytics
 * - Rate limiting for form submissions
 * - Email notifications for new contacts
 * 
 * All backend contact processing has been removed for static site conversion.
 * Contact forms may still exist in the frontend but will not have functional
 * backend processing.
 * 
 * For a production static site, consider implementing:
 * - Static form handling services (Netlify Forms, Formspree, EmailJS)
 * - Client-side form validation
 * - Third-party contact management (Google Forms, Typeform, etc.)
 * - Email integration services (SendGrid, Mailchimp, etc.)
