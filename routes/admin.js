/*
 * ADMIN ROUTES - REMOVED FOR STATIC SITE
 * 
 * This file previously contained Express.js routes for administrative functions
 * including contact management, user administration, and dashboard statistics.
 * 
 * Original functionality included:
 * - Contact form submissions management (CRUD operations)
 * - Contact status tracking (new, read, replied, closed)
 * - Contact notes and administrative comments
 * - Dashboard statistics and analytics
 * - User management for admin roles
 * - Bulk operations on contacts
 * 
 * All backend administrative functionality has been removed for static site conversion.
 * Admin panels and dashboards may still exist in the frontend but will not have
 * functional backend processing.
 * 
 * For a production static site, consider implementing:
 * - Static admin dashboards with preset data
 * - Integration with headless CMS systems
 * - Third-party admin services (Airtable, Google Sheets, etc.)
 * - Contact form submissions via static form services
