/*
 * DATABASE CONFIGURATION - REMOVED FOR STATIC SITE
 * 
 * This file previously contained SQLite database configuration and helper
 * functions for the Node.js backend application.
 * 
 * Original functionality included:
 * - SQLite database initialization and connection
 * - Database schema creation (users and contacts tables)
 * - Database helper functions for CRUD operations
 * - Default admin user creation
 * - Database file management and backup utilities
 * 
 * All database functionality has been removed for static site conversion.
 * The application no longer requires server-side data persistence.
 * 
 * For a production static site, consider implementing:
 * - Client-side data storage (localStorage, sessionStorage)
 * - Static data files (JSON, CSV)
 * - Headless CMS integration (Strapi, Contentful, Sanity)
 * - Cloud database services with client-side SDKs
 * - Serverless functions for data processing when needed
